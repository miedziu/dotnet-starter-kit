/// persisted on a <see cref="MessageAttachmentDto"/> is a short-lived presigned URL captured at send
/// time — it expires, breaking historical images. For every attachment that carries a
/// <c>FileAssetId</c> we mint a fresh presigned URL via <see cref="GetFileDownloadUrlQuery"/> (which
/// also enforces the file's access policy), so the link is always valid when the page is fetched.
/// If a file can't be resolved (deleted / access denied) the stored URL is kept as a best-effort
/// fallback rather than failing the whole page.
